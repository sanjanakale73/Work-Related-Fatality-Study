# Work-Related-Fatality-Study: An In-depth Analysis using Python and MySQL

### Description:
The Work-Related Fatality Study is a comprehensive analysis of fatal incidents that occurred in various workplaces. In this project, I have undertaken the task of exploring and understanding the factors contributing to work-related fatalities, identifying trends and patterns, and providing insights to improve workplace safety measures

### Columns:
ID: Unique identifier for each incident.
Incident Date: Date of the fatal incident.
Day of the Week: Day of the week for the incident date.
City: The city where the incident occurred.
State: State where the incident occurred.
Description: Detailed account of the incident's circumstances and causes.
Plan: Existing safety plans or protocols at the workplace.
Citation: Information on regulatory citations related to the incident.
Unnamed: Unused column.

### Data Pre-processing using Python for Enhanced Analysis:
I have utilized Python to preprocess the data effectively. With libraries such as Pandas and Numpy, I've handled data cleaning and missing values, performed data transformations, and converted data types as needed. 

### Analyzing Data using MySQL:
I have crafted complex SQL queries involving subqueries, joins, and window functions to solve intricate analytical problems and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
I have used MySQL to answer to given problem statements:
  1. What is the number of reported incidents?
  2. What is the year-to-year change in the number of fatal incidents?
  3. What is the number of fatalities that received a citation?
  4. What day of the week has the most fatalities, and what is the overall percentage?
  5. What is the number of fatalities involving welding?
  6. What are the last 5 fatalities during welding?
  7. Which are the top 5 states with the most fatal incidents?
  8. What are the top 5 states that had the most workplace fatalities from stabbings?
  9. What are the top 10 states that had the most workplace fatalities from shootings?
  10. What is the total number of shooting deaths per year?
